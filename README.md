# HK-setting-specific

this is to provide code and anonymized data for HK's setting-specific COVID-19 transmission heterogeneity analysis

"update sampling.R" and "mixture model.R" are for generation interval estimation
"tupper.R" is the cluster size model that I studied from Tupper et al eLife 2022, and I adjusted the code from matlab (their original version) to R
